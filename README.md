# PySoaper
PySoaper is a testing framework for Python that is loosely based on Jest.
It's had a few changes to fit python better, namely limiting the use of anonymous functions because lambdas are a lot more verbose than arrow functions.
A few personal touches have been added as well.

This is not gauranteed to get future support. This is a one-time personal project and might be abandoned at any point.
